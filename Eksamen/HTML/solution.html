    <h1>The Product</h1>

    <p> Self-ED is a company that has a goal to give every child access to good quality education.
      With focus on providing education in a safe environment where the children and their parents
      feel that they are learning in a protected setting.<br> <br>
      The app is mainly for populations in developing countries.
      Statistics from various non-profit organizations have shown that children in developing countries do not have access to quality education (Rueckert, 2019).
      <br><br> In addition, the app focuses on giving girls free and quality education.
      It is a well-known fact that girls/women do not get access to the same opportunities as boys/men in developing countries.
      <br><br>Therefore, we wish to implement Self-ED in developing countries
       to increase the number of girls educating themselves and gaining primary and secondary education (Paddison, 2015).</p>

       <p class="NigeriaSituation">The situation is worse in certain places. An example is the northern part of Nigeria, where the net attendance rate is 53 %, while for females it is only approximately 47 %. <br><br>The main reasons for not attending are economic barriers, socio-cultural norms and practices that discourage attendance in formal education, especially for girls (Unicef, 2017).</p>

  <h1 class="ThePilotNigeria">Pilot</h1>
  <p>
      Self-ED has therefore decided that the project will be launched in Nigeria.
      It will be a pilot project in Nigeria and ensuing this it will be implemented in other countries as well.
      The solution will mainly focus on implementing an education platform that covers primary- and secondary education.
      <br><br>In addition, Self-ED focuses on making quality education accessible for girls. We believe that with the help of our platform, girls will be able to educate themselves without breaking any socio-cultural norms and practices.

    <h1>The App</h1>
    <p> The syllabus will be built upon the international criteriaâ€™s set by international educational authorities and fill the necessary needs of children in the country. The app will consist of various subjects that will cover different topics. The topics will be presented in online videos that cover the topic in an understanding manner.<br><br> The online session will last for 20 minutes, but to cover larger topics longer videos will be made. There will also be scripts available from the videos, which allows deaf children to attain the information. Our organization will corporate with a local university that can help us cover the necessary education criteria for the country. <br><br>In addition, the university will be able to manage the progress of students to find out if the classes are to advanced or too easy for the student. In order, to provide the app in the local area we at Self-ED have decided that with the help of the department of education and universities we will provide translated content in the local language.<br> <br></p>
