    <h1>Our Solution</h1>
    <p> Nigeria is one of the many nations where children do not have access to quality education.
      According, to UNICEF one in every five of the world’s out-of-school children are in Nigeria
      (Unicef, 2017). 10.5 million of the country’s children aged 5-14 years old are not in school. <br> <br>
      In addition, only 61 % of 6-11-year-olds regularly attend primary school and only 35.6 % of
      children aged 36-59 months receive early childhood education (Unicef, 2017).
       <br> <img class="PrimarySchool" src="../BILDER/PrimarySchholComp.png"> <br>
      The situation is worse in some places then other, for example in the north of Nigeria the net attendance rate is 53 %,
      while for females in these areas it is only approximately 47 %. <br> <br> The main reasons for not attending are economic barriers,
      socio-cultural norms and practices that discourage attendance in formal education, especially for girls (Unicef, 2017). <br> <br>
      <img class="GenderGap" src="../BILDER/GenderGap.png"> <br>


      Self-ED has therefore decided that the project will be launched in Nigeria. It will be a pilot project that is to be implemented
      in the country and take it forward to other countries from there on. The reason for us to start the project in Nigeria is simply
      because the above-mentioned statistics show us that this is a country in need of this solution. The solution will mainly focus
      on implementing an education platform that covers primary- and secondary education.

  <div class="Solution">
    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>The concept Self-ED builds on launching an app in the country.
      The app will be available to download on the App Store and GooglePlay.
      The user in this instance being children between the age of 6-14 years
      old or their parents can download the app and get free access to quality
      education. The app will consist of online syllabus for 1st grade to the
      10th grade and will be build up step by step.<br> <br>
      <div class="SolutionBilder">

      <img src="../BILDER/SolutionPage2.jpg" alt= "Picture of app"> </div>

      A child will start the education
      program in the 1st grade and build up from there on, it will not be able to jump
      up classes the student can only start 2nd grade after completing 1st grade, but the
      possibility of revisiting the syllabus from the previous year will be possible.<br> <br>
      The syllabus will be built upon the international criteria’s set by international educational authorities
      and fill the necessary needs of children in the country. The app will consist of various subjects that will
      cover different topics. The topics will be presented in online 20-minute short videos that cover the topic
      in an understanding manner.<br> <br> The online session will always be of 20 minutes, but to cover larger topics more
      videos will be made. Our organization will corporate with a local university that will help us cover the necessary
      criteria for the country. In addition, the university will be able to manage the progress of students to find out if
      the classes are to advanced or too easy for the student.

    <h1>The Product</h1>
    <p> Quality education is one of the United Nations sustainability goals and it focuses on ensuring
      inclusive and equitable quality and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all (United Nations, 2015).
      Self-Ed builds on some of the targets the United Nations have set with regards to quality education. <br> <br>
      One of the targets is that by 2030 all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary
      education (United Nations, 2015). The second target is to eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure
      equal access to all levels of education (United Nations, 2015). <br> <br>
      The app is mainly for populations in developing countries as statistics from various non-profit organizations have shown that
      children in developing countries do not have access to quality education (KILDE). In addition, the app focuses on giving girls
      free and quality education. <br> <br> It is a well-known fact that girls/women do not get access to the same opportunities as boys/men
      in developing countries, therefore, we wish to implement Self-ED in developing countries to increase the number of girls
      educating themselves and gaining primary and secondary education (KILDE).
