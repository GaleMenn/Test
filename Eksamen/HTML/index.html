    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>The barriers are many for children living in poverty with regards to gaining quality education.

      Research has shown that access to education improves many other issues in society such as health, grows the economy, longevity of a society and can even combat climate change (Rueckert, 2019). <br> <br> In developing countries children still
      have limited access to good quality education due to various reasons such as language barriers, gender roles and reliance on child labor (Rueckert, 2019). <br> <br> In a rapport by Global Citizen they have listed the 10 greatest challenges in
      global education that need to be addressed to achieve Quality Education by 2030 (Rueckert, 2019). <br> <br> To mention some of the challenges: A lack of funding for education, Having no teacher or having an untrained teacher, No classroom,
      Gender, long travel distance between home and school, the expense of education etc. (Rueckert, 2019).
